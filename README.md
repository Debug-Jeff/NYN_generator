# NOT YET PDF Generator 🎨

  > *Have you ever thought of having a document template for fun with filler words?*

  A whimsical Python program that generates chaotic PDF documents filled with     
   "NOT YET" text scattered randomly across pages. Perfect for when you need      
  placeholder content that screams organized procrastination.

  ## What Does It Do? 🤔

  Creates beautiful chaos by:
  - Randomly scattering "NOT YET" text across PDF pages
  - Using random fonts, sizes, colors, and rotations
  - Generating both dense chaos and centered poster styles
  - Making procrastination look artistic

  - **Poster Mode**: Clean center text with subtle background chaos
  - **Random Typography**: Multiple fonts, sizes, and orientations
  - **Color Variety**: Mostly black with occasional red highlights
  - **Artistic Opacity**: Varying transparency for depth

  ## Installation 🚀

  ```bash
  pip install reportlab

  Usage 💫

  python main.py        # Creates NOT_YET_NUCLEAR.pdf
  python not_yet.py     # Creates NOT_YET_POSTER.pdf

  Why "NOT YET"? 🤷‍♀️

  Sometimes you need a document that perfectly captures the essence of "I'll      
  get to it later" while looking surprisingly sophisticated.
